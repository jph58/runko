# Modern C++14/Python3 toolbox for plasma simulations

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/natj/runko.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/natj/runko) [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/runko/badge/?version=latest)](https://runko.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest) [![MIT](https://badges.frapsoft.com/os/mit/mit.svg?v=102)](https://github.com/natj/runko/LICENSE) 

Runko is a collection of numerical algorithms written in modern C++14/Python3 to simulate astrophysical plasmas. The framework consists of various physics modules that can be run independently or combined to create multi-physics simulations. Low-level "kernels" are implemented in modern C++ that allow to write modular and high performance code. These fast low-level classes are exposed to Python making it also easy to use and extend them. This ensures efficient code, rapid prototyping, and ease of use.

Under the hood, the framework uses the massively parallel grid infrastructure library [corgi](https://github.com/natj/corgi) that relies on decomposing the grid to smaller subregions, called tiles, that can be operated on and updated independently of each other. [Corgi](https://github.com/natj/corgi) also automatically parallelizes the simulations and provides dynamic load-balancing capability. Therefore, small simulation setups can be tested locally on laptops and then extended for massively parallel supercomputer platforms (currently tested up to ~10k cores).

Documentation is available from [runko.readthedocs.io](https://runko.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest). 

Design and usage of the code is described in detail in the accompanying [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.06306).


## Available modules
Current main physics simulation modules include:
- **FDTD electromagnetic field module** based on staggered Yee lattices (`fields/`)
- **2D3V Particle-In-Cell module** (`pic/`)
- **1D3V Relativistic Vlasov module** (`vlasov/`)
- **2D Force-free electrodynamics** module (`ffe/`)

Additionally, modules under construction include:
- Non-linear Monte Carlo **radiation module** (`radiation/`)
- Full **3D3V Vlasov module**


## Quick getting started guide
1) Follow the [installation instructions](https://runko.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) to get Runko running on your laptop.
2) Add your own project repository under `projects/` directory.
	- This can be based on, for example, Python drivers in `projects/tests/`
3) Test & prototype your new simulation setups on your laptop/desktop.
4) Simulate on supercomputers!

## Showcase

### Relativistic kinetic turbulence 	
PIC module has been used to simulate formation of turbulence in collisionless magnetically-dominated pair plasma.

We start by perturbing the initial magnetic field in an otherwise uniform box of plasma. Magnetic eddies are quickly seen to develop. When the eddies collide, thin current sheets are formed. These thin sheets are unstable for magnetic reconnection that starts to tear the sheets and produce plasmoid.

### Collisionless shocks

PIC module has also been used in simulating collisionless shocks. These simulations are based on the common piston setup where plasma is reflected from the leftmost simulation wall and made to collide with itself. A collisionless shock quickly forms stopping the counter streaming plasma.


### Plasma instabilities

Vlasov module has been used to simulate the development of beam instability in a stratified medium. 

In this 1D1V simulation we track the development of stratified beam instability starting from a relative density of ~10^-5 as the incoming beam enters the box. At higher densities of ~1 the beam excites Langmuir wave turbulence and heats the background plasma. This is a density contrast of over 100000!
